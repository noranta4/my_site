I find it interesting to replicate our skills with machines to realize what does (not) really make us humans.

**Bio.** Currently, CS postdoc at the University of Oxford trying to [understand what the whales are saying](https://www.projectceti.org/) through machine learning with [Michael Bronstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bronstein). 

I received my PhD degree in Computer Science cum laude from the Sapienza University of Rome, with a thesis on "Artificial Scientific Discovery" ([video](https://youtu.be/0uD51aHiYlA)). In Rome, I worked in the [GLADIA](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it/) research group, advised by [Emanuele Rodol√†](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-EH4wBYAAAAJ&hl=en). During my PhD, I also worked as an Applied Scientist Intern for the [Amazon Lablet in T√ºbingen](https://www.aboutamazon.eu/news/press-lounge/amazon-establishes-lablet-for-research-on-transparent-artificial-intelligence-in-tubingen) with [Francesco Locatello](https://www.francescolocatello.com/), and I spent time with [Alex Bronstein](https://bron.cs.technion.ac.il/)'s group at Technion in Haifa. I was also an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) student.

Before starting my PhD, I graduated in Physics in 2016 (BSc), with a thesis about using neural networks to spot dark photons at CERN, advised by [Stefano Giagu](https://stefanogiagu.site.uniroma1.it/); 
and two years later in Computer Science (MSc), by defeating the Italian Othello champion with a cheap reimplementation of AlphaGo Zero from scratch, advised by [Alessandro Panconesi](https://sites.google.com/a/di.uniroma1.it/panco). 
Along with [Roberto Di Leonardo](https://www.roma1.infn.it/~dileorob/), he was also my tutor at the pivotal [Sapienza School for Advanced Studies](https://web.uniroma1.it/sssas/en/study-ssas).
In this period, I also worked as a Research Intern for [Spiketrap](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/01/reddit-acquires-contextualization-company-spiketrap-to-boost-its-ads-business/) with [Andrea Vattani](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~avattani/).

**What makes us humans?** 

I am interested in understanding what allowed humans to reach the Moon. What do we have that animals and machines are missing? 

To me this gap is the consequence of a fundamental property of nature, which we can understand by figuring out how to build machines that match our skills.
At long last, we have machines capable enough, and we can submit our models of human skills to experimental evaluation.
This is a groundbreaking moment in science: AI is doing now what physics did centuries ago, gloriously taking from philosophy the duty of explaining some fundamental aspects of reality, such as what knowledge is and how it is created.

Currently, I am obsessed with our use of symbols, especially by the mechanism through which humans link meaning to new signs, such as when a redditor creates a new meme, or a scientist proposes a new theory.

I want to build machines capable of writing scientific articles about their new ideas, pushing our knowledge forward.
