I am a Computer Science PhD student at the Sapienza University of Rome in the [GLADIA](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it/) research group, where I work with [Emanuele Rodolà](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-EH4wBYAAAAJ&hl=en) on AI and deep learning.
Before joining the group, I studied physics (BSc), computer science (MSc), and pursued the [SSAS](https://web.uniroma1.it/sssas/en/sssas/ssas/about-us ) interdisciplinary honors program.
I worked as a remote Research Intern for [Spiketrap](https://www.spiketrap.io/) (San Francisco, CA), and as an Applied Scientist Intern for the [Amazon Lablet in Tübingen](https://www.aboutamazon.eu/news/press-lounge/amazon-establishes-lablet-for-research-on-transparent-artificial-intelligence-in-tubingen) (Germany).


**What makes us humans?** I am interested in the intelligence that makes the fundamental difference existing between humans and the other animals.
To me this discontinuity is on par to the one between life and non-life, and as the latter should be understood in terms of information processing.
I believe that today we have a formidable tool to investigate this question -computers- and un unprecendented opportunity to expand our knowledge in one of the biggest misteries of nature.
Currently, I am persuaded that this intelligence coincides with our use of symbols, and that what should be modeled is the dynamic mechanism through which humans associate meanings to signs.
