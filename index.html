I am a Computer Science PhD student at the Sapienza University of Rome in the [GLADIA](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it/) research group, where I work with [Emanuele Rodolà](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-EH4wBYAAAAJ&hl=en) on AI and deep learning.

Before joining the group, I studied physics (BSc), computer science (MSc), and pursued the [SSAS](https://web.uniroma1.it/sssas/en/sssas/ssas/about-us ) interdisciplinary honors program.
I worked as a remote Research Intern for [Spiketrap](https://www.spiketrap.io/) (San Francisco, CA), and as an Applied Scientist Intern for the [Amazon Lablet in Tübingen](https://www.aboutamazon.eu/news/press-lounge/amazon-establishes-lablet-for-research-on-transparent-artificial-intelligence-in-tubingen) (Germany).

**What makes us humans?** 
I am interested in the intelligence that accounts for the difference existing between human beings and the other animals.

To me this gap is on par to the one between life and non-life and is the consequence of a fundamental property of nature, that should be understood in terms of information processing.
I believe that today we have a formidable tool to investigate this question -computers- which have just reached the power needed to submit our hypotheses to experimental evaluation.
Currently, I am persuaded that this intelligence coincides with our use of symbols, and that we shall model the mechanism through which humans give meaning to new signs. I bet on the need for a learned interpreter.
