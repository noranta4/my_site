I am Antonio Norelli, a Computer Science PhD student at the Sapienza University of Rome working on AI and deep learning in the [GLADIA](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it/) research group, advised by [Emanuele Rodolà](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-EH4wBYAAAAJ&hl=en).

Before joining the group, I studied physics (BSc), computer science (MSc), and pursued the [SSAS](https://web.uniroma1.it/sssas/en/sssas/ssas/about-us ) interdisciplinary honors program.
I worked as a remote Research Intern for [Spiketrap](https://www.spiketrap.io/) (San Francisco, CA), and as an Applied Scientist Intern for the [Amazon Lablet in Tübingen](https://www.aboutamazon.eu/news/press-lounge/amazon-establishes-lablet-for-research-on-transparent-artificial-intelligence-in-tubingen) (Germany).

**What makes us humans?** 
I am interested in the intelligence that accounts for the difference existing between human beings and the other animals.

To me this gap is on par to the one between life and non-life and is the consequence of a fundamental property of nature, that should be understood in terms of information processing.
Currently, I am persuaded that this intelligence coincides with our use of symbols, and that we shall model the mechanism through which humans link meaning to new signs. As when a scientist propose a new theory.

**Highlights of my research in this direction**
- When a ML system becomes an artificial scientist: mastering the game of [Zendo](https://www.nickbentley.games/zendo-as-a-tool-for-teaching-the-scientific-method/) with Transformers. <br>*Explanatory Learning: Beyond Empiricism in Neural Networks* \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10222)\] \[[code](https://github.com/gladia-research-group/explanatory-learning)\] \[[Judea Pearl about this work](https://twitter.com/yudapearl/status/1496048047805063168)\].
- The meaning was already there: connecting text and images without training a neural network to do so. <br> *ASIF: Coupled Data Turns Unimodal Models to Multimodal Without Training* \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01738)\] \[code soon!\] \[[Alex Smola about this work](https://twitter.com/smolix/status/1577640836124225537)\].

**Other featured research**
- It happens that different neural networks trained on the same stuff learn intrinsically equivalent latent spaces. A simple non-parametric transformation unveils a common representation. <br> *Relative Representations Enable Zero-shot Latent Space Communication* \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15430)\] \[[code](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=SrC-nwieGJ&name=supplementary_material)\] \[[8-8-10 ICLR reviews](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SrC-nwieGJ)\]. 
- I built from scratch an AlphaGo Zero for the game of Othello and challenged a former world champion in a live match at Sapienza University <br> *OLIVAW: Mastering Othello without Human Knowledge, nor a Penny* \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17228)\].
