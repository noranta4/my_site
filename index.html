I am Antonio Norelli, a Computer Science PhD student at the Sapienza University of Rome working on AI and deep learning in the [GLADIA](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it/) research group, advised by [Emanuele Rodolà](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-EH4wBYAAAAJ&hl=en).

Before joining the group, I studied physics (BSc), computer science (MSc), and pursued the [SSAS](https://web.uniroma1.it/sssas/en/sssas/ssas/about-us ) interdisciplinary honors program with [Roberto Di Leonardo](https://www.roma1.infn.it/~dileorob/) and [Alessandro Panconesi](https://sites.google.com/a/di.uniroma1.it/panco) as tutors.
I worked as a Research Intern for [Spiketrap](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/01/reddit-acquires-contextualization-company-spiketrap-to-boost-its-ads-business/) with [Andrea Vattani](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~avattani/), and as an Applied Scientist Intern for the [Amazon Lablet in Tübingen](https://www.aboutamazon.eu/news/press-lounge/amazon-establishes-lablet-for-research-on-transparent-artificial-intelligence-in-tubingen) with [Francesco Locatello](https://www.francescolocatello.com/). Currently, I am a visiting PhD student at Technion, where I work with [Alex Bronstein](https://bron.cs.technion.ac.il/).

**What makes us humans?** 
I am interested in the intelligence that accounts for the difference existing between human beings and the other animals.

To me this gap is on par to the one between life and non-life and is the consequence of a fundamental property of nature, that should be understood in terms of information processing.
Currently, I am persuaded that this intelligence coincides with our use of symbols, and that we shall model the mechanism through which humans link meaning to new signs. As when a scientist proposes a new theory.

**Highlights of my research in this direction**
- When a ML system becomes an artificial scientist: mastering the game of [Zendo](https://www.nickbentley.games/zendo-as-a-tool-for-teaching-the-scientific-method/) with Transformers. <br> *Explanatory Learning: Beyond Empiricism in Neural Networks*, 2022 \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10222)\] \[[code](https://github.com/gladia-research-group/explanatory-learning)\] \[[Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/noranta4/status/1493893787696906241?s=20)\] \[[Judea Pearl about this work](https://twitter.com/yudapearl/status/1496048047805063168)\].
- The meaning was already there: connecting text and images without training a neural network to do so. <br> *ASIF: Coupled Data Turns Unimodal Models to Multimodal Without Training*, 2022 \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01738)\] \[[code](https://github.com/noranta4/ASIF)\] \[[Alex Smola about this work](https://twitter.com/smolix/status/1577640836124225537)\].

**Other featured research**

- With the right geometric prior, 11 samples are enough to train a generative model for 3D shapes of humans or animals. <br> *LIMP: Learning Latent Shape Representations with Metric Preservation Priors*, 2020 \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12283)\] \[[code](https://github.com/lcosmo/LIMP)\] \[Oral at ECCV 2020 ([2 min](https://youtu.be/NPE_uey-dXo), [10min](https://youtu.be/P4uxICQ3QXI) video)\].

**Advising**

I enjoy mentoring younger students and coadvising them on their thesis with prof. Rodolà. Sometimes this activity takes a lot of time but we have fun and I find it very fulfilling. If you are super passionate about AI and looking for what to do next or for a thesis (maybe an AI agent for a board game involving a cool challenge?) feel free to reach out at \[my last name\] at di.uniroma1.it!

Students I am advising/had advised on their BSc/MSc thesis:
- Robert Adrian Minut, MSc, *Backward LLMs*
- Alessandro Zirilli, BSc, *AlphaZero for Hex*
- Ahmedeo Shokry, MSc, *AI and Feynman Diagrams*
- Giovanni Quadraroli, BSc, *DeepRL for Space Invaders*
- Guido Maria D'Amely Di Melendugno, MSc, *DL for Contract Bridge* (Now PhD at Sapienza)
