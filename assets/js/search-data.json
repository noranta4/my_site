Before joining the group, my studies have embraced two big fields, physics and computer science, and have been contaminated by many others, thanks to the SSAS interdisciplinary honor program. . . What makes us humans? My personal search for an answer today is focused on the fundamental nature of knowledge and what makes learning possible. . My current research interests include two great challenges of deep learning, namely the data/computation bottlenecks and the generalization gaps. Today my best bet to solve these challenges involves including natural language in the neural pipeline. . .
